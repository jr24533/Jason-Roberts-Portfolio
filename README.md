# Jason-Roberts-Portfolio
Online Portfolio for Jason Roberts

Having spent 6 years working in the motor trade spending almost every weekend and bank holiday in an empty showroom I dcided to make a change.

I opened Little Angels, a Play Cafe for children, however I quickly learned that having a prime location is costly.  Like a lot of new businesses we didnt last a year.  We closed in July 2017 after 6 months.

Whilst I was there during the quiet periods I was learning HTML and CSS.  Thats when I decided I needed to make a change and so I enrolled on the Open University Diploma of higher Education in Computing and IT.

Whilst studying I thought I would put what I am learning into practice and build a portfolio of works.  My CV is also on here but I want to build around that to increase employability.
